# <div align="center">Miho Inagaki<div>

I'm a infectiously passionate full stack developer with a high communication skill and a focus on building stronger team bond. After several years of Anthropological training in Kyoto and London, I changed my career path joining [Subly](https://www.getsubly.com/) where I'm currently working as a junior full-stack developer. I love continuously improving my tech skills by pushing boundaries and consistent learning as well as enjoy solving problems by finding optimum solutions.

Before starting my career as a developer, I spent some years on helping sustainable food productions in Cambodia, Australia and Japan. I found my skills and knowledge are best used in 'engineering towards better society' and improving web accessibility.

## <div align="center">Collaboration & communication</div>

Working and living in different parts of the world has cultivated my unparalleled attention to diverse perspectives and ability to balance conflicting opinions. My communication skills have been sharpened further through working remotely for a small team at Subly. Actively engaging with peer review and jumping on bug-fix as well as taking the lead to set up office days are the things I prioritize in order to build stronger team bond and to promote a supportive work environment. Beyond dev team, I also maintain close communication with the head of marketing to keep up with the company's changing strategies. I've found having openness, constructive discussions and supportive relationship inside a team are the keys to higher job satisfaction and higher productivity amongst the workers.

## <div align="center">Think big & think ahead</div>

As a former research student in Anthropology, I'm good at paying attention to both big and small pictures. I often found that having enough exposure to up-to-date knowledge about my company's roadmap and marketing data is just as important as day-to-day coding. Providing a context, these sorts of information has helped me quickly and accurately understand "why" we need to develop certain features and "which" work should be prioritized. Also, I always try to identify flaws in designs and to think about possible consequences of my implementation before starting coding and don't hesitate to give others feedbacks if necessary.

## <div align="center">High motivation & consistency</div>

Though I joined Subly as a frontend engineer, I'm now regularly working for backend as well. This is the result of my continuos endeavour to push my boundaries both at and outside of work in order to learn new skills as quickly as possible in a cutting-edge developing environment. Over the last nine month, I've contributed to a number of bug-fix and feature development, which involves designing and creating UI, reusable components, endpoints, writing tests, and preparing migration. Making a list of things to learn as well as learning code in every morning before work has become my habit in order to offer better solutions to wide range of challenges we come across in fast development environment, which are often complex. This eagerness to learn and consistency has been proven to be positively infectious to my entire company - I was officially selected as "the most passionate employee in 2022" at Subly.
