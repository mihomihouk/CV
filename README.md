## <div align="center">Collaboration & communication</div>

Working and living in different parts of the world has cultivated my unparalleled attention to diverse perspectives and my ability to balance conflicting opinions. My communication skills have been sharpened further through working remotely for a small team at Subly, a UK tech startup. Actively engaging with peer review and jumping on bug-fix as well as taking the lead to set up office days are the things I prioritize in order to build stronger team bonds and to promote a supportive work environment. Beyond the dev team, I also maintain close communication with the head of marketing to keep up with the company's changing strategies. I've found having openness, constructive discussions and supportive relationships inside a team are the keys to higher job satisfaction and higher productivity amongst the workers.

## <div align="center">Think big & think ahead</div>

As a former research student in Anthropology, I have a sharp eye for big and small pictures. I often found that having enough exposure to up-to-date knowledge about my company's roadmap and marketing data is just as important as day-to-day coding. This sort of information has helped me quickly and accurately understand "why" we need to develop the features that we're working on, and "which" task should be prioritized. Also, I always try to identify design flaws and possible technical challenges before writing code. If necessary, I don't hesitate to give others feedback.

## <div align="center">High motivation & quick learner</div>

Though I started off as a self-tought engineer, it didn't take much time for me to gain confidence in full stack implementations. This is the result of my continuous endeavour to push my boundaries through work and personal projects, which have helped me to learn new skills as quickly as possible in a cutting-edge developing environment. Over the two years, I've contributed projects at if, Japanese tech firm, and Subly. My contribution includes a number of bug-fix and feature development, which involves updating database, designing and creating UI, engineering reusable components and endpoints, writing tests. I've also developed my own apps to offer a solution to existing problems in our society. My current project, Growcally, showcases my strong full stack knowledge and ability to build high quality and secure apps. My passion towards coding and eagerness to learn have been proven to be positively infectious to other peer workers - I won "the most passionate employee in 2022" at Subly.
